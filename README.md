## secrets.js

Get your API keys from [here](https://ruqqus.com/settings/apps) and add them to `./secrets.js`

export const ClientSecret = "CLIENT SECRET HERE"
```

## Todo

- [ ] Icon and logo design
- [ ] Still waiting on app keys from ruqqus admins
- [ ] Implement app ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

<sup>* I don't have an iPhone so iOS compatibility is gonna be shotty. If you have an iPhone and are willing to fix, plz submit pull request</sup>
